 - [HW1](assignment1) Pacman ``Search`` that implements DFS, BFS, UCS, A-star, Greedy
 - [HW2](assignment2) Pacman Ghost ``Adversaries`` that implements Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, Expectimax
 - [HW3](assignment3) Backjack Agent that implements a generic ``MDP`` solver using policy iteration, value iteration. 
 - [HW4](assignment4) ``CSP`` solvers for Zebra Puzzle, N-Queens, Soduku, and course scheduling. MCV variable ordering heuristics, LCV value ordering heuristics, algorithms that enforces arc-consistency, breaking n-ary factors to binary.
 - [HW5](assignment5) Pacman Ghost Hunter using ``Bayesian Network`` that implements exact inference, approximate inference using particle filter.
 - [HW6](assignment6) Spam Classification (perceptron algorithm, multiclass classifier) and Image Classification (feature extraction using K-means followed by logistic regression or hinge loss gradient descent).
